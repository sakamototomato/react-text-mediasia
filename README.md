# Asteroids Frontend Interview

## Program description

Build an asteroid mining simulation, using react connecting to an express, node, websocket server (provided by Slingshot at [asteroids-backend](https://git.mediasia-group.com/mediasia-interactive/asteroids-backend)).

The simulation starts with 3 planets, 20 asteroids and 9 miners.

Each miner is assigned to a specific planet. A miner is a spacecraft which can travel from its planet to an asteroid, and mine its minerals.
Each miner has a mineral carry capacity, a travel speed and a mining speed. Miners start the simulation from their origin planet, will travel to an asteroid, mine minerals, and return back to their planet to drop the minerals.

A planet can store minerals. Each planet can spawn new miner when it has enough resources. It takes 1000 minerals to spawn a new miner, and the minerals are removed from the planet.

Each asteroid has a limited quantity of minerals, which decreases when it is mined by a miner, up to depletion. 
An asteroid can be mined by only one miner at a time.

The simulation is based on an event loop, 1 second in real life equals 1 year in the simulation.

There is no final goal to reach. The goal is that the simulation works.

## Rules

#### Map

- The map is a grid of 1000 * 1000. The position of the planets, asteroids and miners is contained within this grid.
- A position on the map is a `int` ranging from `0` to `999`.


#### Time

- One second (1000ms) in real life is 1 year in the simulation


#### Planet

- A planet can store an infinite number of mineral.
- A planet has a position (`x`, `y`)
- A planet can spawn a miner
	- A planet can spawn a miner only when it has enough mineral (the cost to spawn a miner is `1000` minerals)
	- A planet can spawn an unlimited amount of miners, as long as it has enough minerals
	- When a miner is spawn, the amount of minerals (`1000` minerals) is substracted from the planet's total mineral storage (the mineral can never reach a negative number)
	- Spawning a miner is done manually from the frontend (see design)


#### Miner

- A miner has 3 main characteristics:
	- `carryCapacity` (`int` from `1` to `200`), this is the maximum number of minerals a miner can carry at one time
	- `travelSpeed` (`int` from `1` to `200`), this is the travel speed per year of a miner when moving on the map
	- `miningSpeed` (`int` from `1` to `200`), this is the number of minerals a miner can mine per year
- A miner has a position (`x`, `y`)
- A miner belongs to a planet and can only transfer minerals to the planet is belongs to
- A miner can travel:
	- from its origin planet to an asteroids
    - from an asteroid back to its origin planet
- A miner can mine an asteroid:
	- The miner needs to be at the same position as the asteroid to be able to mine it
    - The miner can mine a maximum of `miningSpeed` minerals per year (ie. if mining speed is 30, the miner will mine 30 minerals per year)
- At the start of the simulation all miners are positionned at their original planet
- A miner has a status:
	- `0` (`int`): Idle
	- `1` (`int`): Traveling
	- `2` (`int`): Mining
	- `3` (`int`): Transfering minerals to planet
- Each time a miner does an action, its action should be recorded in database, in a `history` table
- Miner actions / history are:
    - Miner spawn on planet `[planet name]`
	- Traveling from planet `[planet name]` to asteroid `[asteroid name]`
	- Mining asteroid `[asteroid name]` for `[number of years]` years
	- Traveling back from asteroid `[asteroid name]` to `[planet name]`
	- Transfering minerals to planet `[planet name]`
	- ... and others if you think they make sense


#### Asteroid

- An asteroid has a position (`x`, `y`)
- An asteroid has a status (`1`: `has minerals`, `0`: `depleted`) - default to `1`
- An asteroid has an amount of minerals (it starts with a random amount from `800` to `1200`)
- When a miner mines an asteroid, the amount of mined minerals is substracted from the amount stored in the asteroid
- When an asteroid has no minerals anymore, its status changes from `1` to `0`

#### Mineral

- An amount of mineral is always an `unsigned int`

## Structure

The deliverable a frontend built using React.

The frontend shoud interact with the backend in 2 ways:

- Websocket:
	- All planet, miners and asteroids status and information displayed on the frontend should be updated live via a websocket connection to the backend
	- Each time a miner, planet, asteroid is created or modified on the backend, it should be updated live on the frontend
- REST API:
	- All data should be accessible via a REST API structure:
		- GET `/miners`: return the list of miners
		- GET `/miners?planetId=[planet ID]`: return the list of miners from a given planet ID
		- GET `/miners/[miner ID]`: return a miner based on its ID
		- POST `/miners`: create a miner
		- PUT `/miners/[miner ID]`: update a miner based on its ID
		- DELETE `/miners/[miner ID]`: delete a miner based on its ID
	- Same instruction for planets and asteroids


## Frontend

The frontend is simple in terms of design. What we are paying attention to is the API and Websocket integration.
